# Privacy Policy for WriteTex Obsidian Plugin

This Privacy Policy explains how the WriteTex Obsidian plugin handles your data.

## No Collection of Personal Information
The WriteTex Obsidian plugin **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information** or data from your Obsidian vault to any third-party servers managed by the developers. 

## Local Server Justification
The plugin starts a local server on your computer for the following purposes:
1. **Local Communication**: To allow the WriteTex mobile or tablet application to communicate directly with your Obsidian desktop instance over your local network (LAN).
2. **Data Proxying**: To receive captured math or text data from the WriteTex app and insert it directly into your active Obsidian note.
3. **AI Integration**: If you have configured an AI API (e.g., OpenAI), the server may proxy requests to the provider you specified. This is done to provide context-aware OCR results. Your data is only sent to the API provider you have explicitly configured in the settings.

All communication between the WriteTex app and the plugin occurs within your local network, and no data is shared with the plugin authors.

## Third-Party Services
If you use the AI features of the plugin, your data will be subject to the privacy policy of the AI service provider you configure (e.g., OpenAI).
